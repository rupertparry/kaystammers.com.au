          Kay is one of the pioneer female television journalists, beginning her
          career in the seventies as reporter for Nine's ground-breaking daytime
          current affairs show <span class="title">No Man's Land</span> –
          produced and presented by women for women – before being snapped up by
          Mike Willesee for his new current affairs program
          <span class="title">24 Hours</span>, screened nationally on the Ten
          Network.

          After a career in teaching lasting 3 years, she entered television
          quite by chance. While sunbathing in a bikini at Sandringham Beach
          during the summer holidays, she was approached by a news photographer
          to take her photo. That photo appeared the next day on Page 3 of The
          Sun, prompting an old university friend, now working as a producer at
          GTV9 News, to give her a call and offer her an audition for a new
          women’s show. She got the job, and teaching was swapped for a career
          in television.
        </p>

        <p>
          After another year working as a reporter for Ten’s Eyewitness News in
          Melbourne, Kay left to travel to England and Europe, but was coaxed
          back by the new Head of Nine's News and Current Affairs, Peter Meakin,
          to join Nine News in Sydney as its sole female reporter. The tight
          knit team of 6 reporters in 1975 included Jim Waley, Ian Ross and
          Robert Penfold.

        <p>
          After five years at the Nine Network Kay spent a year in the UK,
          working as a reporter for ITN and as London radio correspondent for a
          Sydney radio station, before returning to Sydney to take up a position
          as Health, Medical & Consumer news reporter on Ten's EyeWitness News.
          In 1982 she became inaugural presenter of Seven's new late night News
          program, NewsWorld, combining newsreading with live studio interviews,
          a position she enjoyed for several years.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Lifestyle programs began in the eighties with Burke's Backyard,
          Kay returned to Nine as consumer reporter for the show. She even did a
          story on her own marriage, reporting from the location on her wedding
          day, and continued reporting on the show when pregnant, until a month
          before giving birth (breaking new ground as the first pregnant
          reporter ever seen on Australian television).
        </p>

        <p>
          Kay spent several years at ABC-TV in the field of the Arts, as
          reporter/producer for Andrew Saw's State of the Arts and Billboard,
          and celebrity show TVTV, as well as occasional presenter
          of Backchat (filling in for Tim Bowden). She also worked at SBS-TV, as
          Executive Producer of English Language Programs and co-presenter
          of Hello Australia with fellow newsreader George Donikian.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Foxtel started The LifeStyle Channel in the late nineties, Kay,
          by then a mother and author of two books on pregnancy and babies, was
          recruited as the first 'Parenting presenter/producer'.
