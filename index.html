        <h2>Television work</h2>

        <p>
          Kay was one of the pioneer female television journalists, beginning her career in the seventies as reporter for Nine's ground-breaking daytime current affairs show <span class="title">No Man's Land</span> –  produced and presented by women for women – before being snapped up by Mike Willesee for his new current affairs program <span class="title">24 Hours</span>, screened nationally on the 0/Ten Network.

          She entered television quite by chance, after a career in teaching lasting three years. While sunbathing in a bikini at Sandringham Beach during the summer holidays, she was approached by a news photographer to take her photo. That photo appeared the next day on Page 3 of The Sun, prompting an old university friend, now working as a producer at GTV9 News, to give her a call and offer her an audition for a new all-women current affairs show. She got the job, and teaching was swapped for a career in television.
        </p>
        <p>
          After another year working as a reporter for Ten’s Eyewitness News in Melbourne, Kay left to travel to England and Europe with fellow reporter Gail Jarvis, but was coaxed back by the new Head of Nine's News and Current Affairs, Peter Meakin, to join Nine News in Sydney as its sole female reporter. The tight knit team of 6 reporters in 1975 included Jim Waley, Ian Ross and Robert Penfold.

          After five years at the Nine Network Kay spent a year in the UK, working as a reporter for ITN and as London radio correspondent for a Sydney radio station, before returning to Sydney to take up a position as Health, Medical &amp; Consumer news reporter on <span class="title">Ten's EyeWitness News</span>. In 1982 she became inaugural presenter of Seven's new late night News program, <span class="title">NewsWorld</span>, combining newsreading with live studio interviews, a position she enjoyed for several years.

She even did a story on her own marriage, reporting from the location on her wedding day, and continued reporting on the show when pregnant, until a month before giving birth (breaking new ground as the first pregnant reporter ever seen on Australian television).

          In later years, Kay utilised her television and journalistic skills to produce and edit her own TV documentaries and educational videos (specialising in health and medical issues) through Media One, the video production company she formed with her partner Tristan Parry.

        <p>
          Her one hour video <span class="title">Dementia with Dignity</span>, on caring for people with Alzheimer's Disease, is used as a teaching tool in colleges and nursing homes worldwide. Other projects include educational DVDs on pancreatic cancer (commissioned by Cancer Council NSW), ovarian cancer (funded by the Federal Department of Health & Ageing) and meningococcal disease (supported by the NSW State Government).
